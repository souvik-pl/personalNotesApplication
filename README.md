# personalNotesApplication

In this exercise, we'll develop a simple note taking application using HTML, Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript, in which we can add, delete and search for our notes. The notes will be stored in the local storage of the web browser and it will not be deleted even if the browser is closed. The application will also prevent HTML and script injections via input field.
